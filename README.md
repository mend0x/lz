# lz - A Beautiful Directory Listing

`lz` is a command-line program designed to list files and directories in a visually appealing format. It enhances the typical `ls` command by adding decorative elements to the output, making it easier to read and navigate through directories.

## Innovation

Unlike the standard `ls` command, `lz` provides a more structured and aesthetic output by adding a `â”œ` prefix to each file and directory, as well as enclosing the list within separator lines. This format helps in quickly identifying and navigating through files and directories, offering a clearer view of the contents.

## Prerequisites

To build and run `lz`, you need the following:

- **g++** version 7.0 or higher
- Operating System: Linux, macOS, or Windows with MinGW
- Basic knowledge of the command line

## Downloading

To download `lz`, clone the repository from GitHub using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
cd your_repository
